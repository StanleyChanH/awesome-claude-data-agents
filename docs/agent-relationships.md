### 3. Workflow Patterns

#### A. Predictive Modeling Workflow (Most Common)
```
Phase 1: Data Understanding
├── data-explorer (Dataset analysis)
└── sql-analyst (Data extraction) [PARALLEL]

Phase 2: Data Preparation
├── data-cleaner (Quality assurance)
└── feature-engineer (Feature creation) [SEQUENTIAL]

Phase 3: Model Development
├── ml-engineer (Model building)
└── statistical-analyst (Statistical validation) [PARALLEL]

Phase 4: Validation & Visualization
├── model-validator (Performance evaluation)
└── data-visualizer (Results visualization) [PARALLEL]

Phase 5: Quality Assurance
└── data-science-code-reviewer (Code review)
```

#### B. Exploratory Analysis Workflow
```
Phase 1: Data Discovery
├── data-explorer (Initial analysis)
└── sql-analyst (Data querying) [PARALLEL]

Phase 2: Statistical Analysis
├── statistical-analyst (Statistical testing)
└── data-cleaner (Quality issues) [PARALLEL]

Phase 3: Visualization & Reporting
├── data-visualizer (Visual insights)
└── data-science-code-reviewer (Code quality) [PARALLEL]
```

#### C. Time Series Analysis Workflow
```
Phase 1: Data Preparation
├── data-explorer (Temporal understanding)
└── data-cleaner (Time series cleaning) [PARALLEL]

Phase 2: Temporal Analysis
└── time-series-analyst (Forecasting, patterns)

Phase 3: Visualization
└── data-visualizer (Time series plots)
```

### 4. Communication Protocols

#### Agent Handoff Format
Each agent returns structured information for the next agent:

```markdown
## Task Completed: [Task Name]
- **Key Findings**: [Main discoveries]
- **Data Prepared**: [What was prepared for next agent]
- **Next Agent Needs**: [Specific requirements for handoff]
- **Recommendations**: [Suggested next steps]
```

#### Context Passing Rules
1. **Filter Relevant Information**: Only pass data relevant to the next agent
2. **Preserve Key Insights**: Critical findings must be preserved through the chain
3. **Include Data Quality Notes**: Any data issues must be communicated forward
4. **Document Assumptions**: Methodological assumptions must be passed along

### 5. Parallel Execution Capabilities

#### Maximum Parallel Agents: 2
The orchestrator can run maximum 2 agents in parallel to manage complexity and token usage.

#### Parallel Execution Patterns:
- **Data Loading + Initial Exploration**: `sql-analyst` + `data-explorer`
- **Statistical Analysis + Visualization**: `statistical-analyst` + `data-visualizer`
- **Model Validation + Results Visualization**: `model-validator` + `data-visualizer`

#### Sequential Dependencies:
- `data-cleaner` must complete before `feature-engineer`
- `feature-engineer` must complete before `ml-engineer`
- `ml-engineer` must complete before `model-validator`

### 6. Error Handling and Fallbacks

#### Agent Failure Recovery:
1. **Primary Agent Unavailable**: Use fallback agent with broader scope
2. **Task Failure**: Route to appropriate specialist or generalist
3. **Data Quality Issues**: Return to `data-cleaner` for remediation
4. **Model Performance Issues**: Return to `feature-engineer` for feature refinement

#### Fallback Agent Mapping:
```
statistical-analyst → data-analyst
feature-engineer → ml-engineer
time-series-analyst → statistical-analyst
model-validator → ml-engineer
data-visualizer → data-analyst
```
