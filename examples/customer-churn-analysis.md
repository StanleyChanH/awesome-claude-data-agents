# Customer Churn Analysis Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Data Science Agents team to build a comprehensive customer churn prediction model from data exploration to final reporting.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn and identify key factors driving customer attrition.

**Dataset**: Customer data with demographics, usage patterns, and churn labels.

**Python Environment**:
- Data processing: pandas, numpy
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Machine learning: scikit-learn, xgboost
- Statistical analysis: scipy, statsmodels

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Initial Analysis and Planning

```bash
claude "use @data-science-orchestrator to plan a customer churn prediction analysis"
```

The data-science-orchestrator will analyze the requirements and create a comprehensive analytical plan with agent routing.

### 2. Data Exploration

```bash
claude "use @data-explorer to perform exploratory data analysis on the customer churn dataset"
```

Expected outputs:
- Dataset structure and overview (df.info(), df.describe(), df.shape)
- Distribution analysis of key variables (histograms, box plots using matplotlib/seaborn)
- Initial patterns and insights (correlation matrix, pandas profiling)
- Data quality assessment (missing values analysis, data types)
- Hypotheses for further investigation (statistical testing plan)
- Python notebook with exploratory analysis code

### 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

```bash
claude "use @data-cleaner to address data quality issues and prepare clean data for modeling"
```

Expected outputs:
- Missing data handling strategy (SimpleImputer, KNNImputer strategies)
- Outlier detection and treatment (IQR method, isolation forest)
- Data standardization and normalization (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Clean, analysis-ready dataset (pandas DataFrame with proper dtypes)
- Preprocessing pipeline (scikit-learn ColumnTransformer)

### 4. Statistical Analysis

```bash
claude "use @statistical-analyst to analyze relationships between customer attributes and churn"
```

Expected outputs:
- Statistical significance testing
- Correlation analysis
- Segment-based analysis
- Key drivers identification

### 5. Feature Engineering

```bash
claude "use @feature-engineer to create predictive features for the churn model"
```

Expected outputs:
- New feature creation based on domain knowledge
- Feature selection and importance analysis
- Feature transformation and scaling
- Final feature set for modeling

### 6. Machine Learning Model Development

```bash
claude "use @ml-engineer to build and train customer churn prediction models"
```

Expected outputs:
- Multiple model implementations (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model comparison and selection
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Final trained model

### 7. Model Validation

```bash
claude "use @model-validator to thoroughly validate the churn prediction model"
```

Expected outputs:
- Cross-validation results
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC)
- Robustness and reliability testing
- Statistical validation of results

### 8. Results Visualization

```bash
claude "use @data-visualizer to create comprehensive visualizations of the churn analysis results"
```

Expected outputs:
- Feature importance plots
- Customer segment visualizations
- Model performance charts
- Interactive dashboard components

### 9. Code Quality Review

```bash
claude "use @data-science-code-reviewer to review the analytical code for quality and best practices"
```

Expected outputs:
- Code quality assessment
- Reproducibility checks
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Documentation review

- Retraining automation

### 4. Documentation
- Technical documentation
- Business user guide
- Model interpretability report
- Maintenance procedures

## Key Insights Expected

1. **Primary Churn Drivers**: Identify the top factors influencing customer churn
2. **High-Risk Segments**: Customer segments most likely to churn
3. **Intervention Opportunities**: Points where retention efforts would be most effective
4. **Predictive Accuracy**: Model performance in identifying at-risk customers
5. **Business Impact**: Potential ROI from retention efforts

## Success Metrics

- Model AUC > 0.85
- Feature importance interpretation clarity
- Actionable business recommendations

## Follow-up Analysis Opportunities

1. **Cohort Analysis**: Analyze churn patterns by customer cohorts
2. **Lifetime Value Prediction**: Combine churn with CLV analysis
3. **A/B Testing**: Test retention strategies based on model insights
4. **Real-time Scoring**: Deploy model for real-time churn prediction
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Deep dive into specific churn drivers

This example demonstrates the comprehensive end-to-end analytical workflow that the Data Science Agents team can execute, transforming raw data into actionable business insights and production-ready models using the Python data science ecosystem.
