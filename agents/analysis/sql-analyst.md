## SQL Analysis Framework

### 1. Database Schema Analysis
```sql
-- Comprehensive schema exploration
SELECT
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default,
    character_maximum_length
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'your_schema'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

-- Table relationships analysis
SELECT
    tc.table_name,
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.constraint_type,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.table_schema = 'your_schema';
```

### 2. Data Profiling Queries
```sql
-- Comprehensive data profiling
WITH profile_data AS (
    SELECT
        'your_table' AS table_name,
        COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
        COUNT(DISTINCT column1) AS unique_column1,
        COUNT(DISTINCT column2) AS unique_column2,
        SUM(CASE WHEN column1 IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_column1,
        SUM(CASE WHEN column2 IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_column2,
        AVG(CAST(numeric_column AS FLOAT)) AS avg_numeric,
        MIN(CAST(numeric_column AS FLOAT)) AS min_numeric,
        MAX(CAST(numeric_column AS FLOAT)) AS max_numeric,
        STDDEV(CAST(numeric_column AS FLOAT)) AS std_numeric
    FROM your_table
)
SELECT * FROM profile_data;

-- Data distribution analysis
SELECT
    column_name,
    COUNT(*) AS frequency,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) AS percentage,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank
FROM your_table
GROUP BY column_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```

### 3. Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Query execution plan analysis (PostgreSQL)
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE conditions;

-- Slow query identification (MySQL)
SELECT
    query_time,
    lock_time,
    rows_sent,
    rows_examined,
    sql_text
FROM mysql.slow_log
WHERE start_time >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
ORDER BY query_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Index usage analysis (SQL Server)
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(i.object_id) AS table_name,
    i.name AS index_name,
    i.type_desc AS index_type,
    s.user_seeks,
    s.user_scans,
    s.user_lookups,
    s.user_updates
FROM sys.indexes i
LEFT JOIN sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats s
    ON s.object_id = i.object_id AND s.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE OBJECTPROPERTY(i.object_id, 'IsUserTable') = 1
ORDER BY table_name, index_name;
```

## Advanced Query Patterns

### Window Functions for Analytics
```sql
-- Time series analysis with window functions
SELECT
    date_column,
    product_id,
    sales_amount,
    SUM(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date_column) AS running_total,
    LAG(sales_amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date_column) AS previous_day_sales,
    sales_amount - LAG(sales_amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date_column) AS daily_change,
    AVG(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY date_column ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS 7_day_avg,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sales_amount DESC) AS sales_rank
FROM sales_data
ORDER BY product_id, date_column;

-- Customer behavior analysis
WITH customer_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent,
        AVG(order_amount) AS avg_order_value,
        MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date,
        MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date,
        DATEDIFF(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date)) AS customer_lifetime_days
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
customer_segments AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN total_orders >= 10 AND total_spent >= 1000 THEN 'VIP'
            WHEN total_orders >= 5 AND total_spent >= 500 THEN 'Regular'
            WHEN total_orders >= 2 THEN 'Occasional'
            ELSE 'New'
        END AS customer_segment,
        NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS spending_quartile
    FROM customer_metrics
)
SELECT
    customer_segment,
    spending_quartile,
    COUNT(*) AS customer_count,
    AVG(total_orders) AS avg_orders,
    AVG(total_spent) AS avg_total_spent,
    AVG(avg_order_value) AS avg_order_value,
    AVG(customer_lifetime_days) AS avg_lifetime
FROM customer_segments
GROUP BY customer_segment, spending_quartile
ORDER BY spending_quartile DESC;
```

### Complex Joins and Subqueries
```sql
-- Multi-table analytical query
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT
        c.customer_id,
        c.customer_name,
        c.registration_date,
        COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(o.order_amount) AS total_spent,
        AVG(o.order_amount) AS avg_order_value
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_date >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.registration_date
),
customer_preferences AS (
    SELECT
        ol.customer_id,
        p.category,
        COUNT(*) AS purchase_count,
        SUM(ol.quantity * ol.unit_price) AS category_spent
    FROM order_lines ol
    JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN orders o ON ol.order_id = o.order_id
    WHERE o.order_date >= DATEADD(YEAR, -1, GETDATE())
    GROUP BY ol.customer_id, p.category
),
product_recommendations AS (
    SELECT
        co.customer_id,
        cp.category AS preferred_category,
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,
        p.price,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY co.customer_id, cp.category ORDER BY p.popularity_score DESC) AS rec_rank
    FROM customer_orders co
    JOIN customer_preferences cp ON co.customer_id = cp.customer_id
    JOIN products p ON cp.category = p.category
    WHERE p.product_id NOT IN (
        SELECT DISTINCT ol.product_id
        FROM order_lines ol
        JOIN orders o ON ol.order_id = o.order_id
        WHERE o.customer_id = co.customer_id
    )
)
SELECT
    co.customer_name,
    co.total_orders,
    co.total_spent,
    co.avg_order_value,
    pr.preferred_category,
    pr.product_name AS recommended_product,
    pr.price,
    pr.rec_rank
FROM customer_orders co
JOIN product_recommendations pr ON co.customer_id = pr.customer_id
WHERE pr.rec_rank <= 3
ORDER BY co.total_spent DESC, pr.rec_rank;
```

### Pivoting and Conditional Aggregation
```sql
-- Dynamic pivot for sales analysis
SELECT
    product_category,
    region,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31' THEN sales_amount ELSE 0 END) AS q1_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-04-01' AND '2023-06-30' THEN sales_amount ELSE 0 END) AS q2_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-07-01' AND '2023-09-30' THEN sales_amount ELSE 0 END) AS q3_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-10-01' AND '2023-12-31' THEN sales_amount ELSE 0 END) AS q4_sales,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31' THEN order_id END) AS q1_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-04-01' AND '2023-06-30' THEN order_id END) AS q2_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-07-01' AND '2023-09-30' THEN order_id END) AS q3_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN sale_date BETWEEN '2023-10-01' AND '2023-12-31' THEN order_id END) AS q4_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders
FROM sales_fact sf
JOIN products p ON sf.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN stores s ON sf.store_id = s.store_id
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY product_category, region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

-- Customer cohort analysis using conditional aggregation
WITH customer_cohorts AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(order_date)) AS cohort_month,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS order_month,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date), DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(order_date)))) AS period_number
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
),
cohort_sizes AS (
    SELECT
        cohort_month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cohort_size
    FROM customer_cohorts
    GROUP BY cohort_month
),
retention_matrix AS (
    SELECT
        cc.cohort_month,
        cc.period_number,
        COUNT(DISTINCT cc.customer_id) AS active_customers,
        cs.cohort_size
    FROM customer_cohorts cc
    JOIN cohort_sizes cs ON cc.cohort_month = cs.cohort_month
    GROUP BY cc.cohort_month, cc.period_number, cs.cohort_size
)
SELECT
    cohort_month,
    cohort_size,
    MAX(CASE WHEN period_number = 0 THEN active_customers END) AS period_0,
    MAX(CASE WHEN period_number = 1 THEN active_customers END) AS period_1,
    MAX(CASE WHEN period_number = 2 THEN active_customers END) AS period_2,
    MAX(CASE WHEN period_number = 3 THEN active_customers END) AS period_3,
    MAX(CASE WHEN period_number = 4 THEN active_customers END) AS period_4,
    MAX(CASE WHEN period_number = 5 THEN active_customers END) AS period_5,
    MAX(CASE WHEN period_number = 6 THEN active_customers END) AS period_6
FROM retention_matrix
GROUP BY cohort_month, cohort_size
ORDER BY cohort_month;
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### Query Optimization Examples
```sql
-- Optimized vs. non-optimized queries
-- Non-optimized: Multiple joins with filters applied late
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date, p.product_name, ol.quantity
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_lines ol ON o.order_id = ol.order_id
JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2023-01-01'
    AND c.status = 'active'
    AND p.category = 'electronics';

-- Optimized: Early filtering and selective joins
WITH recent_orders AS (
    SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'
),
active_customers AS (
    SELECT customer_id, customer_name
    FROM customers
    WHERE status = 'active'
),
electronic_products AS (
    SELECT product_id, product_name
    FROM products
    WHERE category = 'electronics'
)
SELECT ac.customer_name, ro.order_date, ep.product_name, ol.quantity
FROM recent_orders ro
JOIN active_customers ac ON ro.customer_id = ac.customer_id
JOIN order_lines ol ON ro.order_id = ol.order_id
JOIN electronic_products ep ON ol.product_id = ep.product_id;
```

### Index Strategy Recommendations
```sql
-- Index usage analysis and recommendations
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    attname,
    n_distinct,
    correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, attname;

-- Missing indexes identification (PostgreSQL)
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    attname,
    n_distinct,
    correlation
FROM pg_stats
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    AND n_distinct > 100
    AND correlation < 0.1
    AND attname NOT IN (
        SELECT indexdef
        FROM pg_indexes
        WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    );
```

## Data Quality and Validation

### SQL Data Quality Checks
```sql
-- Comprehensive data quality assessment
WITH data_quality_checks AS (
    -- Null checks
    SELECT
        'customers' AS table_name,
        'customer_id' AS column_name,
        'null_check' AS check_type,
        COUNT(*) AS total_records,
        SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS failed_records,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN customer_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS failure_percentage
    FROM customers

    UNION ALL

    -- Duplicate checks
    SELECT
        'orders' AS table_name,
        'order_id' AS column_name,
        'duplicate_check' AS check_type,
        COUNT(*) AS total_records,
        COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS failed_records,
        ROUND((COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS failure_percentage
    FROM orders

    UNION ALL

    -- Referential integrity checks
    SELECT
        'order_lines' AS table_name,
        'order_id_fk' AS column_name,
        'referential_integrity' AS check_type,
        COUNT(*) AS total_records,
        SUM(CASE WHEN order_id NOT IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS failed_records,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN order_id NOT IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS failure_percentage
    FROM order_lines
)
SELECT * FROM data_quality_checks
WHERE failed_records > 0
ORDER BY failure_percentage DESC;
```
